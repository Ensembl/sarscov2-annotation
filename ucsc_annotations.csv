This variant has implications for development of drugs/therapies that may target regulatory RNA structures, since the emerging variations could cause drug resistance.

This base pairs through its Watson-Crick face with a cytidine residue and interacts with the C of a parallel G:C pair. The U variation is incompatible with both the canonical and non-canonical pairings at this position and is likely to be highly destabilizing to the fold.
